# CBZ/CBR Image Halver

## About:

Lightweight script that splits the images that are packed in .CBZ (or .CBR) format into two (by halving them) and creating a new archive with halved images inside.
Useful if scans that you are currently reading are made by scanning the whole comic book (literally, two pages at the same time). The program will then split those two pages into two separate file.

## How to use:

- Put \*.cbz files (with images) into **./data** folder
- After script completes its run, it will store its output in **./output** folder

Output folder will be created after the operation.
You can safely delete it after you move/copy your files to different location - the script will create it automatically each time it runs.
